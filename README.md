# SoundCircle

**SoundCircle** is a decentralized community board Proof of Concept (PoC) built on top of Soundness.  
It demonstrates how social interactions (posts, community membership) can be verified using Soundness proofs.

## Why SoundCircle?
Current online communities depend on centralized platforms where posts can be censored or accounts removed.  
With SoundCircle:
- ✅ Every post is linked to a verifiable (dummy) Soundness proof  
- 🏘 Communities (Circles) are self-organized  
- 🔐 Posts are censorship-resistant  

---

## Features
- 🎯 Multi-circle support (users can switch between communities)  
- 📝 Post creation with dummy proof generator  
- 🖼 Professional UI with responsive layout  
- 📑 Proofs shown as verification badges under each post

## UI Preview
When opening `index.html`, you will see:  
- A clean header with **SoundCircle** branding.  
- Dropdown menu to switch between demo communities (e.g., *Crypto Builders*, *Web3 Devs*).  
- Posts displayed as modern cards, each showing:  
  - Author (0x address)  
  - Message  
  - Proof badge  
- Form to add new post with:  
  - Address field (0x…)  
  - Message box  
  - Blue **Post** button

## Next Steps
- Integrate real Soundness CLI to replace dummy proof generator.  
- Add profile system (usernames, avatars).  
- Support private circles and invite-only communities.
